# If you want to play with Ruby, we recommend Interactive Ruby -- irb, for short.
# irb is essentially a Ruby "shell" similar in concept to an operating system shell (complete with job control).
# It provides an environment where you can "play around" with the language in real time.
# You launch irb at the command prompt:

# $ irb<irb-options><ruby_script><program-arguments>

# irb displays the value of each expression as you complete it.

# irb also allows you to create subsessions, each one of which may have its own context.
# For example, you can create a subsession with the same (top-level) context as the original session or create a subsession in the context of a particular class or instance.
# The sample session that follows is a bit longer but shows you how you can create subsessions and switch between them.

# See pp 197 for irb session example.

# For a full description of all the commands that irb supports, see Chapter 18, Interactive Ruby Shell, pp 253.

# As with the debugger, if your version of Ruby was built with GNU readline support, you can use Emacs or vi-style key bindings to edit individual lines or to go back and reexecute or edit a previous line -- just like a command shell.

# irb is a great learning tool. It's very handy if you want to try an idea quickly and see whether it works.
