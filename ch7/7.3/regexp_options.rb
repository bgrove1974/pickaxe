# A regular expression may include one or more options that modify the way the pattern matches strings. If you're using literals to create the Regexp object, then the options are one or more characters placed immediately after the terminator. If you're using Regexp.new, the options are constants used as the second parameter of the constructor.
# i -- case insensitive
# o -- substitute once
# m -- multiline mode
# x -- extended mode -- allows you to insert spaces and newlines in the pattern to make it more readable

# Another set of options allows you to set the language encoding of the regular expression.
