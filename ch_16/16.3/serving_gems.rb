# SERVING PUBLIC RUBYGEMS

# RubyGems.org has become the main repository for public Ruby libraries and projects.
# And, if you create a RubyGems.org account, you can push your .gem file to their public servers:

# $ gem push anagram-0.0.1.gem 

# And, at that point, any Ruby user in the world can do this:

# $ gem search -r anagram 

# And, even better, can do this:

# $ gem install anagram
