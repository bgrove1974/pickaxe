# ADDING EVEN MORE AUTOMATION

# The Jeweler library (http://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler) can create a new project skeleton that follows the layout guidelines in this chapter.
# It also provides a set of Rake tasks that will help create and manage your project as a gem.

# If you are a Rails user, you will have come across bundler, a utility that manages gems used by your application.
# Bundler is more general than this; it can be used to manage the gems used by any piece of Ruby code.

# Some people like the extra features of these utilities, while others prefer the leaner "roll-your-own" approach.
# Whatever route you take, taking the time to package your applications and libraries will pay you back many times over.

# SEE YOU ON GITHUB 

# Finally, if you are developing a Ruby application or library that you'll be sharing, you will probably want to store it on GitHub.
# Although it started as a public Git repository, GitHub is now a community in its own right.
# Think of GitHub as a home away from home for many in the Ruby community.
