# So, I have ignored some stuff that you would want to do before distributing your code to the world.
# Your distributed directory tree really should have a README file, outlining what it does and probably containing a copyright statement; an INSTALL file, giving installation instructions; and a LICENSE file, giving the license that it is distributed under.

# You will probably want to distribute some documentation as well.
# This would go in a directory called doc/, parallel with the bin/ and lib/ directories.

# You might also want to distribute native C-language extensions with your library.
# These extensions would go in your project's ext/ directory.
